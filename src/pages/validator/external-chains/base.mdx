Instructions to set up your Base (Coinbase L2) node.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: Mainnet for base is not available yet. Instructions will be added after launch.
</Callout>

## Requirements

- [Setup your Axelar validator](/validator/setup)
- Minimum hardware requirements: 16GB RAM, 100GB+ free storage space.
- MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 (tested on 20.04)
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.base.org/guides/run-a-base-goerli-node)


## Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq -y
snap install docker

```

## Configure and start node

1. Clone the Base repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/base-org/node
```

2. In `docker-compose.yml`, uncomment the right .env file according to the network you want to run it on

```bash
    env_file:
      # select your network here:
#      - .env.sepolia
#      - .env.mainnet
```
Update the following variables in your `.env` file
```bash
# [recommended] replace with your preferred L1 (Ethereum, not Base) node RPC URL:
OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC=https://rpc.sepolia.org

# [required] replace with your preferred L1 CL beacon endpoint:
OP_NODE_L1_BEACON=https://your.sepolia.beacon.node/endpoint-here
```
3. Run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

4. You should now be able to `curl` your Base node:

```bash
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```

Sync speed depends on your L1 node, as the majority of the chain is derived from data submitted to the L1. You can check your syncing status using the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC on the `op-node` container. Example:

```bash
echo Latest synced block behind by: \
$((($( date +%s )-\
$( curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7545 |
   jq -r .result.unsafe_l2.timestamp))/60)) minutes
```

You can check the latest block against the [explorer](https://goerli.basescan.org/).

Since Base uses the Optimism stack, you can review the [Optimism Instructions](/validator/external-chains/optimism) for more details on expected log output and helpful rpc queries.

### Configure vald

In order for `vald` to connect to your Base node, your Base RPC should be exposed in
vald's `config.toml`
